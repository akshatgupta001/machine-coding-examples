# Machine Coding Round Problems

This repository contains a collection of machine coding round problems and their solutions. Each problem is designed to test different aspects of software development including system design, coding practices, and problem-solving abilities.

## Problems

### 1. Load Balancer
A simple load balancer implementation that distributes incoming client requests across multiple backend servers.

**Key Concepts Tested:**
- System Design
- Concurrency
- Network Programming
- Design Patterns
- Error Handling
